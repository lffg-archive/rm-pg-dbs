You can override the default connection options with the following environment variables:

- `PG_HOST`;
- `PG_PORT`;
- `PG_USER`;
- `PG_PASSWORD`.

You can set the `ALLOW_ANY_DROP` environment variable to `true` to enable the deletion of the `postgres`, `<your-os-username>`, `template1` and `template0` databases, which are filtered out of the selection list by default.
